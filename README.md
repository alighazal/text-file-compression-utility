this compression utitiy is made by Ali Ghazal - 900171722
for CS321 class assignment

How to use:

1- copy your .txt file into the location of your the project
2- choose the desired operation d -> decodeing, ,e -> encoding,
or q- > for quiting.
3- enter the name of the file without the extension !!

then the proccess would be done in a couple of seconds (hopefully!)

and the output would have the same name but different extention (.binary) in case of encoding.

while in case of decoding it would have the lable "-decoded.txt" at the end.

after finishing the encoding proceess this program displays the compression ratio and the encoding efficiency.

notice:

attatched to this program a sample of the files used to test the program:

example:

orginal file: novel.txt

encoded file: novel.binary

decoded file: novel -decoded.txt
